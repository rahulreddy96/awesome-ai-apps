reasoners.py — The five-agent Investment Committee for Argus.

Agent roles:
  1. plan_research      → The Manager      (Adaptive Supervisor)
  2. conduct_research   → The Analyst      (Bull Case)
  3. assess_risks       → The Contrarian   (Bear Case)

NOTE: editors 4 & 5 live in stream.py and run only through the SSE pipeline
      (POST /research/stream/start → GET /research/stream/events/{id}).
      The reasoners in this file (analyst, contrarian, manager) are also
      exposed as standalone AgentField endpoints for direct API access.
